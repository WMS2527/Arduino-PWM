// This is the base example code for making an LED fade in and out.

  // nothing happens in setup

void loop() {
  // fade in from min to max in increments of 5 points:

    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
    delay(30);

  // fade out from max to min in increments of 5 points:
