// This is the base example code for making an LED fade in and out.
// My idea is to have them fade in and out in sequence (Like a "line of light" or something)
int ledPin1 = 9; // LED connected to digital pin 9
int ledPin2 = 10;  // LED connected to digital pin 10
int ledPin3 = 11; // LED connected to digital pin 11
int ledPin4 = 12; // LED connected to digital pin 12
int ledPin5 = 13; // // LED connected to digital pin 13

void setup() {
  // nothing happens in setup
}

void loop() {
  // fade in from min to max in increments of 5 points:
  for (int fadeValue = 0; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue += 5) {
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin2, fadeValue);
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
    delay(30);
  }

  // fade out from max to min in increments of 5 points:
  for (int fadeValue = 255; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -= 5) {
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin2, fadeValue);
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
    delay(30);
  }
